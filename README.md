## Issues and Contribution

If you would like to contribute to this repo please do so by creating a PR. I am open to suggestions.


## Dependencies

Install sddm(Simple Desktop Display Manager).You also need QT5 which includes Qt Quick Controls 2, Qt Graphical Effects, Qt SVG, Qt Quick Layouts with version 5.11 or new.In qt5 video loads so slow and late so you will also need qt6-base.Also megatools to download videos.To do so 


For **Arch** based distros using **pacman**
(Obarun/Artix/Manjaro/KaOS/Chakra etc.)
```bash
sudo pacman -S gst-libav phonon-qt5-gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly qt5-quickcontrols2 qt5-graphicaleffects qt5-multimedia qt6-base megatools --overwrite '*'

```
For **Debian** based distros using **apt**
(Ubuntu/Kali/Neon/antiX etc.Excluding Kubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-libav qml-module-qtmultimedia libqt5multimedia5-plugins qt6-base-dev megatools
```

For **Kubuntu** using **apt**
```bash
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-libav phonon4qt5-backend-gstreamer gstreamer1.0-plugins-good qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtgraphicaleffects qml-module-qtmultimedia qt5-default qt6-base megatools 
```


## Installing and Testing
### NOTE:If you have weird resolution issues reinstall the theme and set desired resolution to 1920x1080
Installation just got easier.Just clone this repo then cd into repo and run installer.
Videos will be installed using megatools.If you are stuck on Login Screen check wiki
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicefaa6waa/genshin-sddm-theme.git
cd genshin-sddm-theme
bash install-sddm-theme.sh
```

If door video and background video is slow then just add MinimumQtVersion=6.2.0 at the end of /etc/sddm.conf file.I assume that you have qt6 installed you can check it by qmake6 --version


After installing and testing if it says invalid credentials on log that means you mistyped the password while installing.To fix this just go to /usr/share/sddm/themes/genshin-sddm-theme/components/credentials.txt and correct the second password.


If you want manual installation:
<details>
<summary><b>‚öôÔ∏èManual Installation Instructions </b></summary>


#__!IMPORTANT NOTE!__
edit credentials.txt like username:password to be able to login.



Follow the steps below to install and test it:

To test it before use you need to install this repo and copy it to your sddm themes folder.


In order to do this:


For Arch based distros:
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/nicefaa6waa/genshin-sddm-theme.git
sudo cp -r genshin-sddm-theme/ /usr/share/sddm/themes/
```
For Debian based distros:
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/nicefaa6waa/genshin-sddm-theme.git
sudo cp -r genshin-sddm-theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/
```
(!!!WITH LATEST VERSION MEGATOOLS DOWNLOADS VIDEOS AUTOMATICALLY!!!)


[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yz2GxV8uvZJM16YSbE2yPRMT58H5o0Bs?usp=drive_link)


Then unzip the downloaded folder to your themes folder.In order to do so:
```bash
For Uncompressed zip
sudo unzip -q -d /usr/share/sddm/themes/genshin-sddm-theme/backgrounds/ ~/Downloads/Uncompressed*.zip
For Compressed zip
sudo unzip -q -d /usr/share/sddm/themes/genshin-sddm-theme/backgrounds/ ~/Downloads/Compressed*.zip
```

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TESTING FIRST.

There may be some visual bugs on varying distros so before changing your theme test it first with the command.
Now, assuming that you've installed it correctly to test it:

```bash
sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme genshin-sddm-theme
```

If background door and loading video loads so slow in your /etc/sddm.conf file add MinimumQtVersion=6.2.0 at the end.Make sure you have qt6 installed by runnig qmake6 --version.

## Applying

If you are new and you don't know how to change the SDDM theme, follow these steps:

If you are on KDE Plasma you can easily change sddm theme from settings.If you use something else

1. Edit the config file in '/etc/sddm.conf'. If you don't have 'sddm.conf' file, then copy it from '/usr/lib/sddm/default.conf'. If you are on hyprdots, then the config file will be in '/etc/sddm.conf.d/kde_settings.conf'.Furthermore you may have kde_settings.conf in your current active sddm theme.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /path/to/your/config/file
    ```

2. Look for the following section in the configuration file:

    ```ini
    [Theme]
    Current=
    ```

3. Change your theme to `genshin-sddm-theme`.
