If you want manual installation:
<details>
<summary><b>⚙️Manual Installation Instructions </b></summary>


Follow the steps below to install and test it:

To test it before use you need to install this repo and copy it to your sddm themes folder.


In order to do this:


For Arch based distros:
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/nicefaa6waa/genshin-sddm-theme.git
sudo cp -r genshin-sddm-theme/ /usr/share/sddm/themes/
```
For Debian based distros:
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/nicefaa6waa/genshin-sddm-theme.git
sudo cp -r genshin-sddm-theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/
```

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yz2GxV8uvZJM16YSbE2yPRMT58H5o0Bs?usp=drive_link)

Then unzip the downloaded folder to your themes folder.In order to do so:
```bash
For Uncompressed zip
sudo unzip -q -d /usr/share/sddm/themes/genshin-sddm-theme/backgrounds/ ~/Downloads/Uncompressed*.zip
For Compressed zip
sudo unzip -q -d /usr/share/sddm/themes/genshin-sddm-theme/backgrounds/ ~/Downloads/Compressed*.zip
```

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TESTING FIRST.

There may be some visual bugs on varying distros so before changing your theme test it first with the command.
Now, assuming that you've installed it correctly to test it:

```bash
sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme genshin-sddm-theme
```

## Applying

If you are new and you don't know how to change the SDDM theme, follow these steps:

If you are on KDE Plasma you can easily change sddm theme from settings.If you use something else

1. Edit the config file in '/etc/sddm.conf'. If you don't have 'sddm.conf' file, then copy it from '/usr/lib/sddm/default.conf'. If you are on hyprdots, then the config file will be in '/etc/sddm.conf.d/kde_settings.conf'.Furthermore you may have kde_settings.conf in your current active sddm theme.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /path/to/your/config/file
    ```

2. Look for the following section in the configuration file:

    ```ini
    [Theme]
    Current=
    ```

3. Change your theme to `genshin-sddm-theme`.
