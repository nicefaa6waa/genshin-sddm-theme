## Installing and Testing
Installation just got easier.Just clone this repo then cd into repo and run installer.
(!IMPORTANT NOTE) For some reason video files are not avalible to download with wget,curl or even gdown anymore.Please after using install script go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yz2GxV8uvZJM16YSbE2yPRMT58H5o0Bs?usp=drive_link) link and install videos manually.More details about videos are in "Manual Installation".If you are stuck on Login Screen check wiki
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicefaa6waa/genshin-sddm-theme.git
cd genshin-sddm-theme
bash install-sddm-theme.sh
```
After installing and testing if it says invalid credentials on log that means you mistyped the password while installing.To fix this just go to /usr/share/sddm/themes/genshin-sddm-theme/components/credentials.txt and correct the second password.


If you want manual installation:
<details>
<summary><b>⚙️Manual Installation Instructions </b></summary>


#__!IMPORTANT NOTE!__
edit credentials.txt like username:password to be able to login.



Follow the steps below to install and test it:

To test it before use you need to install this repo and copy it to your sddm themes folder.


In order to do this:


For Arch based distros:
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/nicefaa6waa/genshin-sddm-theme.git
sudo cp -r /genshin-sddm-theme/ /usr/share/sddm/themes/
```
For Debian based distros:
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/nicefaa6waa/genshin-sddm-theme.git
sudo cp -r genshin-sddm-theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/
```
After that install and unzip various backgronud videos.Choose the one you like and download as a zip.

(2,3GB for Uncompressed videos.~400mb For compressed ones)


[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yz2GxV8uvZJM16YSbE2yPRMT58H5o0Bs?usp=drive_link)


Then unzip the downloaded folder to your themes folder.In order to do so:
```bash
For Uncompressed zip
sudo unzip -q -d /usr/share/sddm/themes/genshin-sddm-theme/backgrounds/ ~/Downloads/Uncompressed*.zip
For Compressed zip
sudo unzip -q -d /usr/share/sddm/themes/genshin-sddm-theme/backgrounds/ ~/Downloads/Compressed*.zip
```

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TESTING FIRST.

There may be some visual bugs on varying distros so before changing your theme test it first with the command.
Now, assuming that you've installed it correctly to test it:

```bash
sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme genshin-sddm-theme
```

## Applying

If you are new and you don't know how to change the SDDM theme, follow these steps:

If you are on KDE Plasma you can easily change sddm theme from settings.If you use something else

1. Edit the config file in '/etc/sddm.conf'. If you don't have 'sddm.conf' file, then copy it from '/usr/lib/sddm/default.conf'. If you are on hyprdots, then the config file will be in '/etc/sddm.conf.d/kde_settings.conf'.Furthermore you may have kde_settings.conf in your current active sddm theme.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /path/to/your/config/file
    ```

2. Look for the following section in the configuration file:

    ```ini
    [Theme]
    Current=
    ```

3. Change your theme to `genshin-sddm-theme`.
